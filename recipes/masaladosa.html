        <p>A crispy South Indian rice pancake filled with spiced potato, served with coconut chutney and sambar (a lentil-based stew).</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup besan (chickpea flour)</li>
            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (adjust to your taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p><em>Please note: This recipe is for the dosa only. You choose your favourite masala recipe to accompany this dish! </em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the whole wheat flour, rice flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Whisk to mix. </li>
            <li>Add enough water to make a runny batter, the consistency of a crepe batter.</li>
            <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet or a non-stick skillet. </li>
            <li>Ladle out ⅓rd cup batter in the center of the skillet and using the rounded bottom of a ladle spread the batter quickly in an outward, circular movement.</li>
            <li>You can sprinkle some oil at the edges, if you want to, or spray the edges of the dosa with cooking spray </li>
            (do so carefully by lowering the flame if using a gas stove).
            <li>Once the top is dry, carefully remove the dosa to a plate using a thin spatula. </li>
            <li>Place a few tablespoons of potato sabzi in the center of the dosa and fold the dosa over. Serve immediately. </li>
        </ol>
